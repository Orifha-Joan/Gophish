# Gophish
Phishing emails can range from obvious spam to subtle reconnaissance probes, and more dangerously, to targeted Business Email Compromise (BEC) attacks that impersonate trusted individuals or platforms.  This project leverages GoPhish to simulate real-world phishing campaigns in a safe, controlled environment.
